## Overview

The *peanutButter* web application allows you to produce gridded population estimates using your own estimates of people per building. This is a quick and simple approach that utilizes high resolution maps of building footprints, assuming that the same number of people live in each building across entire regions or settlement types (e.g. urban and rural). WorldPop partners with Maxar Technologies, Ecopia.AI, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for recent maps of buildings extracted from Maxar's <a href="https://www.digitalglobe.com/products/mosaics" target="_blank">Vivid Imagery Mosaic</a> (Ecopia.AI and Maxar Technologies 2020, Dooley and Tatem 2020).

```

The peanutButter application has two tools that can be used to produce gridded population estimates: aggregator and disaggregator. The aggregator tool will apply your estimates of people per building in urban and rural areas to every building and then aggregate buildings to estimate population sizes for every ~100 m grid cell. The disaggregator tool starts with user-defined population totals for administrative units (or other areas) and disaggregates the population evenly among buildings. 

The prefered approach will depend on the information that you have available:  

- Use the aggregator tool if you have estimates of people per building for urban and rural areas.  
- Use the disaggregator tool if you have estimates of total population in each administrative unit.

Code for the *peanutButter* R package is openly available from WorldPop on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/wpgp/peanutButter" target="_blank">https://github.com/wpgp/peanutButter</a>.

### Advantages  
- The peanut butter method is quick and easy to implement in situations where detailed population estimates are not currently available.  
- High resolution building footprints provide a valuable source of information about where populations are located and their relative densities.

### Disadvantages
- This method is not objective or driven by population data (i.e. household surveys). It relies on your subjective estimates of population characteristics.  
- There are no estimates of uncertainty provided by this method. You will have no objective basis for determing the accuracy of the estimates produced.  

## Quick Start: Aggregator Tool
1. Use the sliders to explore population parameters until you find a combination that produces reasonable estimates (shown in the 'Results' table) of total population, urban population, and rural population for the country as a whole. 

2. Adjust the age-sex sliders to select the demographic group(s) that you would like your gridded population estimates to represent. Note: this will not change the population totals shown in the 'Results' table.

3. Use the "Gridded Population Estimates" button to generate a gridded population map (a geotiff raster) that is produced by applying your population parameters to building footprints in each approximately 100 m grid cell across the country.  

4. (optional) Use the "Settings" and/or "Source Files" button(s) to save the input data.

## Quick Start: Disaggregator Tool
1. Upload a GeoJson file containing polygons and their associated population totals, by clicking on the "Browse" button and selecting your GeoJson file. Ensure that you have the correct country selected.

2. Adjust the age-sex sliders to select the demographic group(s) that you would like your gridded population estimates to represent. 

3. Use the "Gridded Population Estimates" button to generate a gridded population map (a geotiff raster) that is produced by disaggregating a polygon's population total evenly across the buildings inside the polygon.

4. (optional) Use the "Source Files" button to save the input data.


## More Info: Aggregator Tool

### Method

The aggregator tool requires you to provide estimates of three population characteristics for urban and rural settlement types using expert opinion:  

1. Mean number of people per housing unit  
2. Mean number of housing units per building  
3. Proportion of buildings that are residential  

These three parameters will be multiplied together to estimate people per building footprint.

Areas have been pre-classified as 'urban' based on two simple rules that are consistent across all countries. A ~100 meter grid cell is classified as 'urban' if it is part of a grouping of contiguous cells with: 1) 1,500 or more cells, and; 2) 5,000 or more buildings (Dooley and Tatem 2020). All grid cells containing building centroids that do not meet the 'urban' criteria, are classified as 'rural'.

The population is estimated using the following formula:  

`Population = Pop_Urban + Pop_Rural`  

`Pop_Urban = Buildings_Urban x PropResidential_Urban x UnitsPerBuilding_Urban x PeoplePerUnit_Urban`  

`Pop_Rural = Buildings_Rural x PropResidential_Rural x UnitsPerBuilding_Rural x PeoplePerUnit_Rural`

You can supply your own inputs (i.e. raster of building count, raster of urban/rural classification) to produce gridded population estimates using the "aggregator" function of the <a href="https://github.com/wpgp/peanutButter" target="_blank">peanutButter</a> R package.

### Population Parameters

**Mean people per housing unit**  
This parameter defines the average number of people in a housing unit and it can be defined for urban and rural areas separately. References for determining these values could include:  

- <a href="https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/home" target="_blank">WorldBank Microdata Library</a>  
- <a href="https://www.statcompiler.com/en/" target="_blank">STATCompiler from the DHS Program</a>  
- <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/data/" target="_blank">DHS survey data from USAID</a>  
- <a href="https://mics.unicef.org/surveys" target="_blank">MICS survey data from UNICEF</a>  
- <a href="https://international.ipums.org/international/" target="_blank">IPUMS Census Microdata</a>  
- <a href="https://population.un.org/Household/index.html#/countries/728" target="_blank">United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs</a>  

**Mean housing units per building**  
This parameter defines the average number of housing units per residential building. This number would be expected to be near 1 for rural areas and slightly higher in urban areas.

**Proportion residential buildings**  
This parameter defines the proportion of buildings that are residential (total building counts from Dooley and Tatem 2020). Some buildings are non-residential like factories, shops, barns, and sheds. In addition, there are some erroneous building footprints that do not represent buildings and others that may represent more than one building.

### Default Values

We provide moderately informative default values for population parameters, but we strongly urge users to modify the defaults based on a thorough investigation of available data sources. Our process for selecting default values was:  

1. Look up average household sizes (<a href="https://population.un.org/Household/index.html#/countries/728" target="_blank">UN 2019</a> or <a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/ageing/household_size_and_composition_around_the_world_2017_data_booklet.pdf" target="_blank">UN 2017</a>). We assumed that household sizes were equal in urban and rural areas. If no estimate was availabe, we assumed an average of 5 people per housing unit. 

2. Assume there was an average of 1.1 housing units per building in urban areas and 1 housing unit per building in rural areas.  

3. Adjust the proportion of buildings that are residential until the total population matched the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.pop.totl" target="_blank">WorldBank estimates</a>, assuming the same proportion of residential buildings for urban and rural areas. For countries where population estimates were available from the <a href="https://wopr.worldpop.org" target="_blank">WorldPop Open Population Repository</a>, we used those total populations instead.

## More Info: Disaggregator Tool

### Method  

The disaggregator tool produces gridded population estimates by disaggregating user-defined population totals evenly among buildings within user-defined polygon boundaries (e.g. administrative boundaries). There are three steps involved in this process:  

1.  Calculate the total number of buildings in each polygon using the source data from Dooley and Tatem (2020) that were derived from high resolution building footprints (Ecopia.AI and Maxar Technologies 2020).

2. Calculate the average number of people per building by dividing the user-provided population total for each polygon by the total number of buildings in that polygon. 

3. Produce gridded estimates by multiplying the average people per building by the total number of buildings in each ~100 m grid cell.  

User-provided polygons will be ignored if they are too small to overlap the centroid of at least one 100-m grid cell from the building raster (see [Source Data]). If this happens, the total population of the gridded population estimates (i.e. summing all cells) will exclude the populations from these small polygons.

If there are zero buildings within any user-provided polygons, then the gridded population estimates will contain NA for these grid cells.

Areas of your polygons that exceed the national boundaries used in the building footprints (see [Source Data]) will not contain gridded population estimates.

## More Info: Age-sex  

Gridded population estimates for specific demographic group(s) are produced the same way for the top-down and bottom-up methods using ~100 m gridded estimates of the proportion of population in each age-sex group (WorldPop et al. 2018). There are 2 steps involved:  

1. Sum the individual age-sex proportions for each grid cell across the age-sex groups selected using the sliders.  

2. Multiply the resulting grid of proportions by the gridded estimates of total population from the bottom-up or top-down method.

To produce gridded population estimates for specific age-sex groups using your own inputs (i.e. population raster, or region-specific age-sex proportions), you can use the "demographic" function from the <a href="https://github.com/wpgp/peanutButter" target="_blank">peanutButter</a> R package. For an example of the age-sex information needed, please refer to the 'agesex' files downloaded when clicking on the "source files" button for any country.

## Source Data

In the peanutButter app, there are several source datasets working behind the scenes that you can download using the "Download Source" button.  

There are two data sets describing building patterns (Dooley and Tatem 2020) that were derived from building footprints (Ecopia.AI and Maxar Technologies 2020):  

1. The count of buildings in each ~100 m grid cell across the country,  
2. A classification of each ~100 m grid cell as urban or rural.

There are also two source datasets that provide the proportion of population in each demographic group for every ~100 m grid cell (WorldPop et al 2018, Pezullo et al 2017, Carioli et al in prep). The age-sex source files include:  

1. A spreadsheet with age-sex proportions for each region,  
2. A region ID for every 100 m grid cell.  

## Year of Outputs  

The time period associated with gridded population estimates produced by peanutButter depends on several factors. The spatial distribution of the population across the country depends on the spatial distribution of building footprints. The age-sex breakdown depends on the source demographic data. The population totals depend on the population data that you provide. 

**Building footprints**  
The satellite imagery used to create the building footprints is from <a href='http://www.digitalglobe.com/products/mosaics', target='_blank'>Maxar's Vivid imagery mosaics</a>. The exact date depends on the specific satellite image used in the mosaic at a given location. The average mosaic image is less than 20 months old (Ecopia.AI and Maxar Technologies 2020). 

**Demographic data**  
The demographic data (WorldPop et al. 2018) describing age-sex proportions and their spatial distribution are based on projections that represent the year 2020, but they do not account for potential effects of population displacement and migration.

**Population data**  
Bottom-up: The time-point represented by the gridded population estimates is influenced by the date of your settings for "people per housing unit", "housing units per residential building", and "proportion of buildings that are residential". The date reflected by our default values is usually 2018-2019. For more information, refer to our sources described in the sub-section "Default Values" from [More Info: Bottom-up].  

Top-down: The time-point of the gridded population estimates is influenced by the date of the population totals in your uploaded geojson file.
